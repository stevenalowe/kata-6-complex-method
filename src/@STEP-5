Welcome to Step 5!

Extracting a method object was pretty simple, right?

Now we can extract domain-level helper methods for each kind of output, without having to pass a bunch of parameters around.

Go ahead and do that now - each distinct output chunk should end up in its own helper method, including its guard conditions. That way, the 'main logic' in the top-level method just becomes a series of calls to helper methods, and its NPATH complexity returns to sane levels.

Note that now you can also extract helper methods for the remaining complex conditionals, the ones that spanned more than one object that we couldn't eliminate earlier. Do that too - when you're done, each if-statement's conditional expression should be a single function call, with an informative, domain-related name.
